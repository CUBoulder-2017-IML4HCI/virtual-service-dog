# Virtual Service Dog
The Virtual Service Dog is an Android app aimed at users with debilitating mental illnesses, but may also be useful for anyone who experiences high levels of stress. It relies on data from the built-in camera and accelerometer to determine the user's heart rate and shakiness, then runs it through Java-ML to guess whether or not they may be stressed. It learns from the user's data over time and incorporates that into its predictions.
